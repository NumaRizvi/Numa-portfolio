                Web Development: I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the structure, style, and interactivity of web applications. They use HTML to create the basic content structure, CSS to design the layout and appearance, and JavaScript to add functionality and dynamic features. <br><br>User Experience (UX): I used to create a positive user experience. in which i need to ensure that the application's interface is intuitive and user-friendly. This involves considering factors such as navigation, readability, and ease of use. <br><br>Responsive Design: With the proliferation of various devices and screen sizes, I need to ensure that their designs are responsive. This means that the web pages and applications should adapt and look good on a wide range of devices, from desktops to smartphones and tablets.
